# libxml2-win-build

libxml2 Windows build with Visual Studio.

This version is libxml2-2.9.9.

To build, simply open the required solution file, and
you know how to use Visual Studio, right?
(or perhaps this is the wrong place for you.)

Depends on libiconv-win-build and zlib-win-build.
There are hard references assuming both libiconv-win-build and
zlib-win-build sit next to libxml2-win-build.

Basically, in a command prompt:

> \> cd {somewhere}\\  
> \> git clone https://github.com/kiyolee/libiconv-win-build.git  
> \> git clone https://github.com/kiyolee/zlib-win-build.git  
> \> git clone https://github.com/kiyolee/libxml2-win-build.git

Build libiconv and zlib first and then libxml2, with the same corresponding Visual Studio solution of course.

This repository tracks only officially released versions of libxml2.
Check branch win-build of https://github.com/kiyolee/libxml2.git that follows latest development.
