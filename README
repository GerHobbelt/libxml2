This is a fork of the...

                  XML toolkit from the GNOME project

... adding experimental support for parsing and generating SML.

For information about SML, see  page 137 of:
http://archive.xmlprague.cz/2018/files/xmlprague-2018-proceedings.pdf

Added two test programs:
- sml2.c: Parse XML or SML as a DOM tree, and output that tree as SML.
- testWriter.c: Adapted from the public testWriter.c, to output SML.

Also added batch scripts to help build a Windows version with Microsoft tools:
- configure.bat: Front end to the existing configuration script.
- make.bat: Front end to Microsoft nmake.exe.
These scripts allow building the Windows version with commands that look the 
same as the commands used to build the Unix versions:

To build libxml2.lib and sml2.exe in Windows with Microsoft tools:
(Assuming you don't have the iconv library installed, as it is not by default.)
- Run the vcvars*.bat for your Visual C++ version.
- Go to the libxml2 win32 subdirectory.
- Run: 
   configure iconv=no
   make STATIC=1 libxmla bin.msvc\sml2.exe
- sml2.exe is stored in win32\bin.msvc

To build libxml2.lib and sml2.exe debug versions in Windows with Microsoft tools:
   make clean
   make DEBUG=1 STATIC=1 libxmla bin.msvc\sml2.exe

Full documentation for the standard version of libxml2 is available on-line at

To build on an Unixised setup:
   ./configure ; make ; make install
To build on Windows:
   see instructions on win32/Readme.txt

To assert build quality:
   on an Unixised setup:
      run make tests
   otherwise:
       There is 3 standalone tools runtest.c runsuite.c testapi.c, which
       should compile as part of the build or as any application would.
       Launch them from this directory to get results, runtest checks 
       the proper functionning of libxml2 main APIs while testapi does
       a full coverage check. Report failures to the list.
