This is a fork of the...

                  XML toolkit from the GNOME project

... adding experimental support for parsing and generating SML.

For information about SML, see:
https://www.tclcommunityassociation.org/wub/proceedings/Proceedings-2013/JeanFrancoisLarvoire/A%20simpler%20and%20shorter%20representation%20of%20XML%20data%20inspired%20by%20Tcl.pdf

Added two test programs:
- x2s.c: Parse XML or SML as a DOM tree, and output that tree as SML.
- testWriter.c: Adapted from the public testWriter.c, to output SML.

To build libxml2.lib and x2s.exe debug versions in Windows with Microsoft tools:
- Run the vcvars*.bat for your Visual C++ version.
- Go to the libxml2 win32 subdirectory.
- Run: 
   configure.bat iconv=no
   exe.bat x2s
- x2s.exe is stored in win32\bin.msvc

To build on an Unixised setup:
   ./configure ; make ; make install
To build on Windows:
   see instructions on win32/Readme.txt

To assert build quality:
   on an Unixised setup:
      run make tests
   otherwise:
       There is 3 standalone tools runtest.c runsuite.c testapi.c, which
       should compile as part of the build or as any application would.
       Launch them from this directory to get results, runtest checks 
       the proper functionning of libxml2 main APIs while testapi does
       a full coverage check. Report failures to the list.
